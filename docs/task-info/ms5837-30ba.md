## EtherCAT Task Introduction

### MS5876 (30BA)

#### Hardware preparation

Connect your MS5876 (30BA) to any ``I2C`` port of your EtherCAT module.

#### Configuration items

* I2C
    * This refers to the ID of the I2C port.
* OSR
    * This refers to the oversampling ratio; a high OSR could give a more precise reading value. This will also
      influence the sample time.
        * 1 = OSR 256, sample time = 0.6 ms * 2
        * 2 = OSR 512, sample time = 1.17 ms * 2
        * 3 = OSR 1024, sample time = 2.28 ms * 2
        * 4 = OSR 2048, sample time = 4.54 ms * 2
        * 5 = OSR 4096, sample time = 9.04 ms * 2
        * 6 = OSR 8192, sample time = 18.08ms * 2
